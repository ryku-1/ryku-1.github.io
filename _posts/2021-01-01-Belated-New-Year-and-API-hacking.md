Hi,

I havent been updating this as often as I would have liked, but I am going to focus on this a little more over the 
next few months. 

I recently decied to take a break from popping shells, and dig a little deeper into the bounty programs available. It isnt something I have done before,
or something I know much about, but a shall shot at a little cash, and some hackity hacks sounds good to me. 

I'll just clarify that im not wanting to bounty hunt full time, this is just another way of learning/playing/exploring, and generally needing a break from what
I have been grinding the last few months. 

I'm not going to screenshot anything here, as i'm hacking a private program. 

I am however going to note down, well, some basic notes, and take what you will I suppose. Remember this is my blog, not a tutorial, its a mash-up of my brain
puked out in some markdown for my/general reference. 

So sorry if you came here hoping for step by step instructions....

So, I'm starting by fuzzing the api endpoints, currently looking at different versions. E.g v1/v2/v3 and hoping to find some /docs, or some decent json output.

Directory scans, Burp, Subfinder
