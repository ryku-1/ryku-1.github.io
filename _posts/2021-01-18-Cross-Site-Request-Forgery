Wusup!

I decided I am going to make a little infographic for most attacks that contain a flow pattern, or maybe for every attack, lets see how this goes first.

Here is my first, as the title says... cross-site-request-forgery. This is only covering a very basic senario, and it is designed to understand the flow of the attack
not how to launch a csrf attack, if you have come here looking for that, maybe later...
